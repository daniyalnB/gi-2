								This scan is executed prior to a loss and typically worked into the underwriting process as an extension of the initial inspections.

								Look for this risk engineering scan to become commonplace by 2021 â€“ it will serve as an incredibly valuable asset as it relates to underwriting, policy renewals, and expedited claims settlement after a catastrophic loss.

								These scans are typically executed to keep property owners, owners agents and mortgage companies apprised of progress.

								These scans are occasionally executed in a restoration environment. 
								They have a proven ability to aid in the release of payments from the mortgage companies (and this will become more commonplace in the years to come). 
								These are also executed to champion the sales process via the Capture application. 
								Showing policyholders a mix of pre/post-mitigation scans and post-repair scans can provide solace that they are working with a seasoned and capable restoration contractor.
